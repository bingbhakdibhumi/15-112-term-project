# Pusheen's Adventures!

This is a platform side scroller where the player get to control a fat cat called 'Pusheen.'

To win, the player must maneuver Pusheen across a map to complete a level. 
Along the way, the player will encounter a series of different types of terrain, interactable objects, and moving enemies.

There are five main components needed to run this game:
- mages folder
- cmu_112_graphics.py
- gameObjects.py
- terrain.py
- game.py

To start the game, make sure that all of the components above are saved in the same folder, then run the program game.py.

Note: You should not need to install any external modules if you are in 15-112. If not, then make sure to install pillow and requests.
      You can do this by opening command prompt and type in 'py -m pip install {module name}'. *Mac and Linux users may have different installation methods
      
Some developer commands:
- press 'q' to manually lose a life; this can be helpful to check out certain features like the 'game over' screen
- press 'r' to restart the entire program; this will also cause a new random set of terrains and power ups to be generated
